# RBDO-Matlab-Double-Loop
This Matlab files are used to demonstrate on how to perform Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) using FERUM. 
Two approaches are used namely: Reliability Index Approach (RIA) and Performance Measure Approach.

The example used to demonstrate here was taken from "Benchmark study of numerical methods for reliability-based design optimization" by Younes Auoes and Alaa Chateauneuf (2009). You can find their paper at DOI: 10.1007/S00158-009-0412-2
